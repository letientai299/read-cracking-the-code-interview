Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row
and column is set to 0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Solution
--------

- Iterative through MxN array one time, have 2 lists for columns and rows that
  should be replaced to 0. (O(mn))
- Iterative through the remembered columns list, set all columns to to 0 (worst
  case O(n^2))
- Iterative through the remembered rows list, set all rows to to 0 (worst
  case O(m^2))

Complexity:
- Time: worst O(m^2) (assume that m >= n)
- Space: worst O(m+x), to store the list of columns and rows


Correction
----------

The solution given in the book is better as it doens't require 2 time Iterative
for rows and columns.
